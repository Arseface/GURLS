<h1>D**MGURLS</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A shameless copy and conversion of the mechanics from DRL's wiki. Both a proof of concept and a completely playable RPG in its own right.</p>

<h3>Dice Notation</h3>

<p>You're going to be rolling a lot of dice when you play. When something says to roll XdY roll X number of Y-sided dice and adds the results together.

For dice with a number of sides that don't exist, you can roll the next highest sided die and reroll max values till you get something legal. For instance, rolling 2d7 you'd roll two eight sided dice and reroll any 8s.

Sometimes a weapon's damage will be listed as (XdY)Ã—Z. This means that the weapon makes Z separate attacks whenever it is fired, and each attack does XdY damage.</p>

<h2>Characters</h2>

<h3>Inherent Qualities</h3>

<p>Players start with 50 health points(HP).</p>

<p>Everybody has a fists weapon and one prepared weapon slot. If you happen to lose your fists for some reason call the weapon something else.</p>

<p>Players have a sight radius of 8 tiles. They're probably 5 ft tiles, but maybe they're a meter or something.</p>

<h3>Classes</h3>

<p>Classes subtly but drastically affect the ability of your character while playing through DoomRL. They come with their own unique strengths, as well as special traits from which only their class can choose. Currently there are no limitations, whether natural or artificial in construct, on what class you can choose for any reason.</p>

<p>All classes have special starting characteristics, an advanced trait they can use from the very beginning of the game (as opposed to needing other traits to unlock its selection), and five unique master traits that highlight the class's uses.</p>

<h4>Marine</h4>

<p>The Marine is the hardy and forceful class, preferring brute strength and sheer power over all else.</p>

<h3>Traits</h3>

<p>This is a technical list of all the traits and what they do. All effects stack additively (so that three ranks in Ironman will give 30 additional HP), unless said otherwise.</p>

<p>Upon reaching level 12, all traits that have a standard max of 3 can be increased to a max of 5, and all traits that have a standard max of 2 can be increased to a max of 3.</p>

<h2>Mechanics</h2>

<h4>Speed</h4>

<p>Everything you do takes time. This is so important the speeds are listed before anything else, including hit points. Since the world of D**m is an adrenaline fueled gorefest time is measured in tenths of seconds instead of seconds. Player characters all start with default movement values. Certain things can change the amount of time it takes to perform and action.</p>

<table><tr>

	<td colspan="2">Movement happens immediately, even when you dodge. This is generally the only exception to the rule where actions that require rolls happen after the time required is spent.</td>

<h4>Dodging</h4>

<p>When a player moves, if a monster declared an attack against them, they can attempt to dodge it.</p>

<p>To dodge, roll 1d20 and add any dodge bonuses for each attack targeting you. On a roll of 21 or higher you succeed. A roll of 1 on the d20 always misses.</p>

<p>If you dodge successfully, then they target the space you were in before. Because bullets move in a line, this means that even if you dodge into a space behind where you were, the attack might still hit you. You might also expose another player, an enemy, or an explosive barrel. Be careful when you dodge!</p>

<h4>Accuracy</h4>

<p>Before you can hurt things with bullets, you have to hit them. Almost every attack, against the player or against the minions of Hell, has a chance of missing its target.</p>

<p>Each attack has an accuracy bonus depending on parameters like the weapon's accuracy and the attacker's traits. To determine if an attack hits, roll 3d6. If you roll a total of 11 or higher, the attack hits. There is one exception to this rule: if the roll is 17 or 18 then the attack always hits, and if the roll is 3 or 4 then the attack always misses no matter how high the accuracy is.</p>

<p>The following properties modify this accuracy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Accuracy of the weapon (each weapon's page lists that weapon's accuracy bonus)</li>
    <li>For the player, each level of the Eagle Eye trait provides a +2 bonus to all attacks </li>
    <li>For each level of Brute, the player also receives an additional +2 bonus to melee attacks</li>
    <li>Aimed shots receive a +3 bonus</li>
    <li>If the attacker is running, it gets a -2 penalty</li>
    <li>If the target is running, the attack receives a -4 penalty</li>
</ul>

<h4>Damage</h4>



<h4>Health</h4>

<table style="float:right"><tr>
	<th>Health Descriptions</th>

	<th>Percent</th><th>Description</th>
	</tr><tr>
	<td>1-10%</td><td>almost dead</td>

	<td>11-20%</td><td>mortally wounded</td>

<p>The players and all other denizens of Phobos have health scores that represent how hard they are to kill. The player's maximum health is 50 at the start of the game. This value can be increased by the Ironman trait.</p>

<p>When a creature is attacked, it receives some amount of damage. This damage is subtracted from the creature's health. If a creature's health is reduced to 0 or lower, then that creature dies.</p>

<p>Each creature also has a maximum health score. This is the amount of health the creature has before it has been damaged. Unlike health, maximum health scores do not typically change.</p>

<p>The health of monsters can be looked at. The GM reserves the right to guestimate instead of doing the math every time they're asked.</p>

<p>There are many items that will restore the players health. Some items, like med-packs, cannot increase the player's health beyond its maximum. Others, like globes, can, but even these cannot increase the player's health past 200% of the maximum.</p>

<p>When the player's health is greater than 100% of the maximum, then the player will lose 1 health every 5.0s. The health decay threshold is increased to 150% of maximum health for the first rank in the Badass trait, and 200% for the second rank.</p>

<h4>Tactics</h4>

<p>The tactics system allows the player to switch between three states: cautious, running, and tired. Players start as cautious. The player can switch from cautious to running, an action that takes 0.1s.</p>

<table><tr>
	<th>Cautious</th><td>Cautious is the default tactic, and applies neither penalties nor bonuses.</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<th>Running</th><td>The running tactic offers some benefits and some penalties.</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td><td>The player moves 0.3s faster to a minimum of 0.1s</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td><td>The player moves an additional 0.3 faster for each 1.0s their movement speed is.</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td><td>The player gets a +4 bonus to dodge rolls.</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td><td>Enemies receive a -4 attack penalty to all attacks against the player.</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td><td>Damage from terrain (e.g. lava) is halved when running.</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td><td>The player receives a -2 accuracy penalty to ranged attacks.</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td><td>The player deals half melee damage.</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td><td>Running lasts for 30 actions (including the switching tactics action) after which tactics change automatically to tired.</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<th>Tired</th><td>The tired tactic doesn't have any penalties or bonuses except that tactics can not be changed when the player is tired.</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td></td><td>In order to change his tactics back to cautious, the player must either rest or use a health recovering item.</td>
</tr></table>

<h4>Experience</h4>

<p>Honestly this is optional. Feel free to level the players up whenever. The player earns experience whenever enemies are killed. Different enemies are worth different amounts of experience (as listed on their individual pages).</p>
