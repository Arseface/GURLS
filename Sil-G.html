<h1>Sil-G</h1>

<h3>Table of Contents</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Sil-G is a tabletop adaptation of the video game Sil and its fork Sil-Q. Sil has a FANTASTIC manual, and I'll be using exerpts from it throughout the rulebook.</p>

<p>Sil is a role-playing game with a strong emphasis on discovery and tactical combat. It has a simple but rich combat system which allows for a great variety of choice: should you wear heavy armour that makes you easier to hit but reduces the damage you take? should you wield heavier weapons to overcome your opponentsâ€™ armour, or wield lighter weapons for more accuracy and a greater chance of critical hits? It depends on the situation and the type of character you become. You will also have the chance to retreat back into shadowy corridors to take the enemy one by one, or to stealthily creep up to your opponent and take him unawares.</p>

<p>It is also one of very few games that stays true to the writings of Tolkien. Carefully researched, it dispenses with many generic fantasy tropes and reveals a different world. There are no wizards or priests, no plate mail or magical scrolls. Instead, it is the Norse Saga inspired world that Tolkien imagined, with warriors clad in shining mail, singing songs of rage or sorrow as they slay. The magic of the world is subtle yet powerful: there are songs of fear and of binding, rather than spells of fireball and teleportation.</p>

<h3>Race and House</h3>

<p>The first choice in creating a character is to choose your race. Sil is unusual among roleplaying games in that the races are intentionally not balanced against one another. Instead, they act like a difficulty level. Playing one of the Noldor will produce the easiest game, and is recommended for first time players. Playing as one of the Naugrim or Sindar is a little harder but can lead to interesting variations in playing style, and playing as one of the Edain is noticeably more difficult, and should be considered a challenge mode. On the other hand, within each race, the Houses are considered as approximately equal in power level.</p>

<p>Each race and house gives you various modifiers to your statistics (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution and Grace), which are added as a bonus or penalty to the numbers you choose for your character. You can see these in the character creation screen. You will also have an affinity or penalty for one or more skills, and may have a proficiency for some types of weapon. </p>

<h4>Affinities</h4>

<ul>
	<li>If you have an affinity with a skill, you get:</li>
	<li>a bonus of 1 to your skill total
	<li>all abilities linked to that skill are 500 experience points cheaper
	<ul>
		<li>in particular your first ability is free!</li></ul></ul>

<h4>Skill Mastery</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Mastery is like a double affinity for a single skill</li>
	<li>you get a bonus of 2 to your skill total</li>
	<li>all abilities linked to that skill are 1000 experience points cheaper</li>
	<ul>	
		<li>(except your first one, which is free rather than giving you experience!)</li></ul></ul>

<h4>Penalty</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Penalty is the opposite of an affinity</li>
	<li>You get a penalty of 1 to your skill total</li>
	<li>All abilities linked to that skill are 500 experience points more expensive.</li></ul>

<h4>Weapon proficiency</h4>

<ul>
	<li>All elves (Noldor and Sindar) have a blade proficiency</li>
	<ul>	
		<li>This gives them a bonus of 1 to their melee so long as they are using a blade (sword or dagger).</li></ul>
	<li>Dwarves (Naugrim) have an axe proficiency</li>
	<ul>	
		<li>This gives them a bonus of 1 to their melee so long as they are using an axe.</li></ul></ul>

<h4>Noldor - The Deep Elves</h4>

<p>Base Stats: Str 0, Dex 1, Con 2, Gra 2<br>
Bow Proficiency<br>
Song Affinity<br>
Minimum Age:20 Maximum Age: 4865<br>
Height 78 inches +- 3<br>
Weight 150 lbs +- 8<br>
The Noldor are known as the 'Deep-elves', for they are the most learned and inventive of the elven kindreds. They saw the light of the Two Trees in Valinor and gained much in lore and skill. They are tall and lithe, yet so strong of spirit that they can endure vast hardship. Their hair is mostly dark and their eyes grey.</p>

<h4>The House of Feanor</h4>

<p>Stat Bonus: Dex +1<br>
Smithing Affinity<br>
Feanor was the greatest of the Noldor, though proud and unyielding. He created the Silmarils which Morgoth later stole, and he led his house across the sea to Beleriand in pursuit. Those of Feanor's house are fiery in temper, but capable of great works of beauty.</p>

<h4>The House of Fingolfin</h4>

<p>Stat Bonus: Con +1<br>
Will Affinity<br>
Fingolfin led his house into Beleriand to protect its peoples from the shadow of Morgoth. Betrayed by the Feanorians, they had to come through the icy wastes of the north. Their people are the most hardy and valiant, most feared by the orcs and hated by Morgoth.</p>

<h4>The House of Finarfin</h4>

<p>Stat Bonus: +1 Con<br>
Perception Affinity<br>
Finarfin himself did not come to Beleriand, but many of his house made the journey under Fingolfin's banner. They are the fairest and wisest of the Noldor. All have golden hair as a mark of their Vanyarin ancestry.</p>

<h4>Sindar - The Grey Elves</h4>

<p>Base Stats: Str -1, Dex 1, Con 2, Gra 1<br>
Bow Proficiency<br>
Song Affinity<br>
Minimum Age:20 Maximum Age: 4865<br>
Height 76 inches +- 3<br>
Weight 148 lbs +- 8<br>
The Sindar are the 'Grey-elves' who never saw the blessed light of the Two Trees, but who found an echo of it in their queen, Melian the Maiar. They are less learned and powerful than the Noldor, but have fair voices and are gifted in song.</p>

<h4>The House of Doriath</h4>

<p>Stat Bonus: +1 Gra<br>
Song Mastery<br>
Most Sindar dwell in the forests of Doriath. Thingol is their king, and rules from Menegroth with Melian at his side. Her power hides Doriath from the servants of Morgoth, allowing the Sindar to hunt and feast as in the days before his shadow grew.</p>

<h4>Those of the Falas</h4>

<p>Stat Bonus: +1 Dex<br>
Archery Affinity<br>
When Thingol met with Melian under the wheeling stars, many of his folk despaired of finding him again and journeyed to the shore, the Falas, to set sail to Valinor. Some tarried there and dwelt in the havens on the edge of Middle-Earth with their lord, Cirdan, the shipbuilder.</p>

<h4>Naugrim - The Dwarves</h4>

<p>Base Stats: Str 0, Dex -1, Con 3, Gra 1<br>
Axe Proficiency<br>
Archery Penalty<br>
Smithing Affinity<br>
Minimum Age:35 Maximum Age: 180<br>
Height 54 inches +- 2<br>
Weight 155 lbs +- 10<br>
The dwarves are stone-hard and stubborn, fast in friendship and in enmity. They live long, far beyond the span of Men but not for ever. They are short in stature, deep-breasted and stout in the leg, and their beards are long. They were named the 'Naugrim' by the Sindar, meaning 'the stunted people'.</p>

<h4>The House of Nogrod</h4>

<p>Stat Bonus: +1 Dex<br>
Smithing Mastery<br>
Nogrod, the 'Hollowbold', is a dwarven stronghold beneath the Blue Mountains. The forges burn brightly in its deep mansions and the smiths of Nogrod are matchless in all Beleriand.</p>

<h4>The House of Belegost</h4>

<p>Stat Bonus: +1 Str<br>
Will Affinity<br>
Belegost, the 'Great Fortress', is a dwarven citadel in the northern ranges of the Blue Mountains. Its stout warriors are legendary for their strength and for the fearsome iron masks they wear to battle.</p>

<h4>Edain - The Mortal Men of the First Age</h4>

<p>Base Stats: Str 0, Dex 0, Con 0, Gra 0<br>
Minimum Age:15 Maximum Age: 45<br>
Height 70 inches +- 4<br>
Weight 150 lbs +- 12<br>
The Edain are the Men of Beleriand. They gained much from dealings with the Noldor, and grew more long lived than their kin beyond the mountains. However, compared to the elves they were more frail, and more easily slain by weapon or mischance. The Edain dwell in the north of Beleriand and help the Noldor to contain Morgoth's power.</p>

<h4>The House of Beor</h4>

<p>Stat Bonus: +1 Con<br>
Evasion Affinity<br>
Those of Beor's house are steadfast in endurance of hardship and sorrow, slow to tears and to laughter; their fortitude needs no hope to sustain it. For the most part they have brown hair with brown or grey eyes.</p>

<h4>The People of Haleth</h4>

<p>Stat Bonus: +1 Dex<br>
Stealth Affinity<br>
The people of Haleth are not eager for lore, and use few words; for they do not love great concourse of men, and many among them delight in solitude, wandering free in the greenwoods. For the most part they are small in stature, with dark hair and dark eyes.</p>

<h4>House of Hador</h4>

<p>Stat Bonus: +1 Str<br>
Melee Affinity<br>
Those of Hador's house are quick to wrath and laughter, fierce in battle, generous to friend and foe, swift in resolve, fast in loyalty and joyous in heart. For the most part they are tall, with flaxen or golden hair, blue-grey eyes and fair skin.</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>The main mechanic in Sil is the skill check. This involves rolling 1d10 and adding the appropriate skill score and comparing this to 1d10 plus the difficulty level. The first total needs to be higher than the second in order to succeed. Skill checks are used in and out of combat, though if any of the first three skills (melee, archery, evasion), then d20s are used instead of d10s. The difficulty for a skill check is often based on an adversaryâ€™s skill. For example, when you try to hit an opponent in melee, your melee skill is opposed to their evasion skill, and when you try to sneak past a monster, your stealth skill is opposed to their perception.</p>

<h3>Movement</h3>

<p>During an encounter the GM will count up for the number of seconds that have passed. They'll say "and" between the numbers to signify half-seconds should somebody need them. When your number comes up, notify the GM and take your turn. If multiple players have turns at the same time, feel free to take them in any order. When it doesn't matter just go clockwise with enemy turns going last.</p>

<p>On a players turn execute the results of their last action including evasion and armor rolls, and declare thier intent for their next action. If the action doesn't require a roll, then they roll for armor and evasion and announce the results on their next turn. If it requires one or more rolls, they make them while play goes around the table and announce the results during their next turn.</p>

<p>Sil-G operates in seconds. Your speed determines how fast a typical action is. There are 4 speeds, any bonuses or penalties that would bring you outside this range cap at the closest legal value.</p>

<table>
	<tr></tr></table>

<ul>
	<li>1 Speed: You move half as fast. Every standard action takes 4 seconds.</li>
	<li>2 Speed: The default. Every standard action takes 2 seconds.</li>
	<li>3 Speed: You move faster than normal. Standard actions take 1.5 seconds.</li>
	<li>4 Speed: You move very fast. Standard actions take 1 second.</li></ul>
		
<h3>Combat</h3>

<p>Each attack you make has two stages:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Roll to see whether you hit your target.</li>
	<li>If you hit, then roll to see how much damage you do.</li></ul>

<h4>Weapons and Armour</h4>

<p>Weapons and armour have a few numbers displayed next to their names which explain how they relate to these two phases of an attack. Take an axe for example:</p>

<p>Battle axe (-3,3d4)</p>

<p>This battle axe provides a penalty of â€“3 to accuracy, and if it hits it does 3d4 points of damage. Armour is quite similar:</p>

<p>Leather armour [-1,1d4]</p>

<p>This suit of leather armour has a penalty of â€“1 to evasion, making you slightly easier to strike than if you were unarmoured. However, it also offers some protection, absorbing 1d4 points of damage each time you are struck. These are very simple examples and sometimes it can be more complex. For example:</p>

<p>Greatsword (-2,3d5) [+1]</p>

<p>Mail corslet (-1) [-3,2d4]</p>

<p>This greatsword offers a +1 bonus to evasion, making you slightly harder to strike. This represents your ability to parry with it. On the other hand, the mail corslet is sufficiently cumbersome that it gives a penalty to accuracy as well as a penalty to evasion. You can work out which numbers apply to offense and which apply to defence as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Offense comes first and is in round brackets.</li>
	<li>Defence comes second and is in square brackets.</li></ul>
	
<h4>Attacking</h4>

<table class="side-text">
	<tr>
		<th>Optional Rule:</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Evasion Averaging and Natural Crits</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Rolling for evasion adds more variance to the fight, which can be exciting. It also takes a lot of rolling. To speed up the game, I reccomend treating every evasion roll as 10 and adding in Natural Crits. A Natural Crit is when you roll a natural 20 on your attacking roll. When this happens, you calculate how heavy the crit would be and you add an additional damage die over that.<br>Doing this keeps the variance reasonably high even though it standardizes it a bit less, and keeps things exciting by adding in some extra impactful moments.</td></tr></table>

<p>To determine whether an attack hits, the attacker makes an attack roll opposing the defenders most recent evasion result. If the attack roll is greater, then the attack hits and they immediately roll for damage.</p>

<p>Attack roll: Attackerâ€™s melee score + 1d20</p>

<p>Evasion roll: Defenderâ€™s evasion score + 1d20</p>

<p>When the attack is declared, the attackers asks the current evasion score of the target and uses that for the attack.</p>

<p>The melee and evasion scores are the associated skills combined with a number of modifiers. Firstly, as noted above, the skills are affected by your weapons and armour. They can also be affected by other things, such as being stunned (which gives â€“2 to all your skills including both melee and evasion), being overwhelmed, and various special abilities. The penalty for being overwhelmed only affects evasion. The size of the penalty depends upon how many monsters are surrounding you, and on where they are relative to the monster who is currently attacking. You get a â€“2 penalty for each monster that is in one of the three sides furthest away from the attacking monster, and a â€“1 penalty for any other adjacent monsters. This is a severe penalty, and even weak monsters can become deadly when they surround you.</p>

<p>Finally, the melee score is halved if the attacker cannot see the defender and the evasion score is likewise halved if the defender cannot see the attacker. Opponents that are unwary count as not being able to see you for these purposes. If you are unfortunate enough to be fighting from within a pit or a web, both your evasion and melee scores are halved (again). If someone is completely unable to move (i.e. an enemy is asleep or the player is entranced) then their evasion score is set to â€“5 irrespective of any other relevant modifiers.</p>

<h4>Doing Damage</h4>

<table class="side-text">
	<tr>
		<th>Reccomended Rule:</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Armor Averaging</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Similar to evasion, rolling for armor adds to variance and excitement. It's also considerably more time intensive so averaging the results is reccomended, especially for the GM. You just take the average of the rolls, round up, and use that instead of rolling every turn.</td></tr></table>

<p>Damage is resolved when an attacker reports the results of the roll on their next turn. When the damage is <i>resolved</i>, the target reduces the damage by the most recent protection roll.</p>

<p>To determine how much damage is dealt when an attack hits, the attacker makes a damage roll and subtracts the reult of the defender's protection rolls. If the result is 0 or less, the attack does no damage. If it is greater, it does damage equal to the result.</p>

<p>In simple cases, the damage roll is just the damage of the weapon, and the protection roll is the sum of the protection rolls for every piece of armour being worn. However, there are often modifiers on the weapon damage. Some of these affect the number of dice that are rolled, while others affect how many sides these dice have.</p>

<p>For each point of strength the attacker has, a side is added to the dice. For example, if you have strength 3 and are wielding the axe mentioned earlier, you would do 3d7 damage instead of the basic 3d4. However, there is a limit to how much strength can be applied with a given weapon. Your strength bonus is limited to 1 point of bonus damage for each 1 lb of weapon weight. For example, no matter what strength you have, you couldnâ€™t get more than 4 bonus sides with a 4 lb battle axe. High strength characters will want to use heavier weapons (to take advantage of their strength) and weapons with many dice (to take advantage of the extra sides). Note that negative strength subtracts sides of damage up to the same strength limit based on weapon weight.</p>

<p>Some weapons are â€˜hand-and-a-halfâ€™ weapons, which can be used one-handed or two- handed. If you are not wearing a shield, you are presumed to be wielding these weapons two-handed and are given a bonus 2 damage sides. To continue the example above, letâ€™s suppose that the battle axe is being used with two hands, giving it a total damage of 3d9.</p>

<p>Extra damage dice are added in two ways. Some weapons are especially deadly against certain enemies. In such cases, they do an extra die of damage. For example, if the axe above is an axe of orc-slaying and is being used against an orc, it will do 4d9 damage instead of 3d9. Elemental brands (such as fire brand or frost brand) are similar, doing an extra die of damage against enemies that do not resist the element and 2 extra dice against enemies that are explicitly vulnerable to it (such as fire damage against a frost demon). As always, damage by your enemies works the same way. For example if a Werewolf bites you with a 2d9 poison attack, you will take 3d9 damage if you do not resist poison. Elemental attacks are thus a bit more dangerous than they first appear in the monster recall window.</p>

<p>It is also possible to get extra dice via critical hits. These are awarded when the attack roll exceeds the evasion roll by a particularly large amount. This amount is determined by the weight of the weapon, with lighter weapons more likely to produce critical hits, due to their easier handling.</p>

<p>To get a critical hit, you need to beat the evasion roll by a certain amount. This amount is 7 points plus one point per pound of weight of your weapon. You are granted a bonus damage die for every multiple of this amount by which you exceed the required score. For example, if wielding a 3 lb longsword, you would need to beat the evasion score by 10 points to get the first bonus die, by 20 points for the second die, 30 points for the third, and so on. This sounds very difficult, but characters who concentrate on accuracy can get very large critical hits, particularly on sleeping or unwary monsters. Of course, monsters can also get critical hits upon you if you are too poor at evasion. You donâ€™t need to memorize this formula; just bear in mind that high accuracy and light weapons can sometimes do a lot of extra damage.</p>

<p>In summary, the weapon damage can gain extra sides from strength or from two-handed wielding, and extra dice from â€˜slaysâ€™ and critical hits.</p>

<h4>Archery</h4>

<p>Archery is very similar to melee, but with a few differences. Firstly, the attack roll uses the archery skill instead of the melee skill. To this is added the attack bonus of the arrow being fired, and a range penalty of â€“1 for every 5 squares the target is from the archer. In addition, the defenderâ€™s evasion score is halved against archery (this can stack with the halvings mentioned above). This makes evasion considerably less useful against archery than against melee.</p>

<p>Damage is calculated almost identically to melee, incorporating strength, â€˜slaysâ€™ and critical hits. The strength bonus of bows is again limited to 1 point per 1 lb of weapon weight.</p>

<p>The range of a bow is equal to 1.5 times the number of sides of damage you do with it. Thus, if you are doing 1d10 with your Longbow, its range will be 15 square.</p>

<p>Finally, it is very dangerous to use your bow when there are enemies in melee range. Firing your bow in such a circumstance will let your guard down. When this happens, all enemies targeting you with melee have the option to either resolve their attack immediately against you and take another turn, OR they can halve your evasion roll for the attack. Enemies adjacent to you attacking other characters may also choose to switch their target to you, though they cannot resolve immediately or halve your evasion.</p>

<h4>Thrown Weapons</h4>

<p>Throwing is like melee, but with a few differences. Firstly, many items are not designed to be thrown and they thus give a penalty of â€“5 to the attack roll when thrown. The items that are designed to be thrown include daggers, throwing axes, spears and tridents. All throwing attacks also suffer a range penalty of â€“1 for every 5 squares.</p>

<p>Damage is just like melee, except that the number of damage sides is halved if the object was not designed for throwing. Thus, even if you can hit with a thrown longsword, it will do a lot less damage than in melee.</p>

<p>The range is calculated from the weight of the object and your carrying capacity (which in turn depends on your strength).</p>

<p>Range: carrying capacity / (5 Ã— (weight + 2))</p>

<p>For example, if you can carry 100 lb and are throwing a spear weighing 4 lb, then your range is 100 / (5 Ã— (4 + 2)) = 3.333 = 3 squares. It's easiest to calculate this before combat and mark it on your sheet.</p>

<h3>Elements and Resistances</h3>

<p>As well as purely physical attacks, there are four special types of elemental attack that some monsters may use against you:</p>

<h4>Fire</h4>

<ul>
	<li>The most common and dangerous element â€” the fires of Angband are legendary.</li>
	<li>It can destroy arrows, bows, axes, polearms, hafted weapons, boots, gloves, cloaks,
soft armour, chests, torches and staffs.</li></ul>

<h4>Cold</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Treated similarly to fire, but less common and less dangerous.</li>
	<li>It can destroy potions and flasks of oil.</li></ul>

<h4>Poison</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Many spiders and werewolves are famed for their deadly poison.</li>
	<li>Instead of damaging you directly, poison damage is added to your poison counter. If you donâ€™t take steps to prevent this, you will eventually suffer all of this damage. Each round, the poison counter is reduced by 20% and you suffer this damage.</li></ul>

<h4>Darkness</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Morgoth is the Lord of Darkness, and some of his servants use darkness itself against you.</li>
	<li>Darkness resistance works differently to the other elements. There is no â€˜darkness resistanceâ€™ available, except a strong source of light. If the light level on your square is above 2, you get a level of darkness resistance counted for each level of excess.</li></ul>

<h4>Elemental Damage</h4>

<p>Elemental attacks are either pure (like dragon breath and poison gas), or mixed with physical damage (like a balrogâ€™s flaming sword). Mixed elemental damage was explained in the combat section: if you donâ€™t have the relevant resistance, you take an extra die of damage. If you are especially vulnerable, you take two extra dice of damage. There is no advantage in having multiple sources of resistance to mixed elemental damage.</p>

<p>Dragons and some other foes have potent elemental breaths. Their breath spreads out in a cone, damaging everything within, but the damage decreases by 2d4 for each square. Armour is usually no defence against such an attack. The only sources of protection that
count are special protection from special abilities, or magical rings and amulets. If it is fire or cold damage, you can also count the protection from your shield. Any damage that gets through this meagre protection is then halved if you have resistance, or divided by three if you have double resistance etc. If you are vulnerable to the element, the damage is doubled.</p>

<h3>Morale</h3>

<p>Sil has a sophisticated morale model for its enemies. Other than mindless creatures (which always just attack you) most enemies take stock of the situation and retreat if needed. They have a morale level which changes depending on the circumstances.</p>

<h4>Bonuses:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>The base for morale (6)</li>
	<li>Appearing after their usual depth (+1 per 50 ft)</li>
	<li>The player is escaping Angband with a Silmaril (+2, instead of the depth modifier)</li>
	<li>The player is blind, hallucinating, or stunned (+2 each)</li>
	<li>The player is confused, slow, afraid, or heavily stunned (+4 each)</li>
	<li>The player is entranced or knocked out (+8 each)</li>
	<li>The player has â‰¤ 75% health (+2)</li>
	<li>The player has â‰¤ 50% health (+4)</li>
	<li>The player has â‰¤ 25% health (+8)</li>
	<li>The monster is hasted (+4)</li>
	<li>Similar creatures in line of sight that are not fleeing (+1 each, or +4 for leaders)</li></ul>
	
<h4>Penalties:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Appearing before their usual depth (â€“1 per 50 ft)</li>
	<li>The monster is stunned (â€“2)</li>
	<li>The monster has â‰¤ 75% health (â€“2)</li>
	<li>The monster has â‰¤ 50% health (â€“4)</li>
	<li>The monster has â‰¤ 25% health (â€“8)</li>
	<li>The monster is already fleeing and â‰¤ 75% health (â€“2)</li>
	<li>Light susceptible and the playerâ€™s square has more than 3 light (â€“1 per level in excess)</li>
	<li>A non-unique monster is carrying items (â€“2 per item)</li>
	<li>The player has the ability Majesty (â€“1 per 4 points of playerâ€™s Will)</li>
	<li>The player has the ability Bane (â€“x, where x is the playerâ€™s Bane bonus)</li>
	<li>Similar creatures in line of sight that are fleeing (â€“1 each, or â€“4 for leaders)</li></ul>
	
<h4>Temporary modifiers (which decay by 1 each turn):</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Unable to escape (+6)</li>
	<li>Just stopped fleeing (+6)</li>
	<li>Just started fleeing (â€“6)</li>
	<li>It (or a similar creature) is hit by a slaying weapon (â€“2)</li>
	<li>It (or a similar creature) is hit by an elemental brand it is especially vulnerable to (â€“2)</li>
	<li>It (or a similar creature) is hit by a Cruel Blow (â€“2)</li>
	<li>A similar creature is killed in line of sight (â€“4, or â€“16 for a leader)</li>
	<li>Song of Elbereth (â€“1 per point by which you won the skill check)</li>
	<li>Horn of Terror, Staff of Majesty (â€“2 per point by which you won the skill check)</li></ul>
	
<p>The morale level of an enemy determines its â€˜stanceâ€™ which can be one of the following three:</p>

<h4>Aggressive</h4>

<ul>
	<li>(Morale > 20)</li>
	<li>Aggressive monsters simply attack you.</li>
	<li>Mindless creatures are always Aggressive.</li>
	<li>Trolls are Aggressive instead of Confident.</li>
	<li>Enemies who have been angered are Aggressive instead of Confident.</li>
	<li>Items of Wrath make creatures Aggressive instead of Confident.</li></ul>

<h4>Confident</h4>

<ul>
	<li>(0 > Morale â‰¥ 20)</li>
	<li>Confident monsters may use tactics while attacking you (such as lurking in rooms waiting for you).</li></ul>

<h4>Fleeing</h4>

<ul>
	<li>(Morale â‰¤ 0)</li>
	<li>Fleeing monsters try to get as far away from you as possible.</li>
	<li>Creatures that are immune to (non-magical) fear stay Confident instead of fleeing</li></ul>
	
<h3>Stealth</h3>

<p>In the tale on which Sil is based, Beren and Luthien did manage to enter Angband, obtain a Silmaril, and escape. This they achieved not by force, but by subterfuge. Similarly it is possible to succeed in Sil by sneaking past your enemies rather than fighting them.</p>

<h4><b>Mechanics</b></h4>

<p>At any time, an individual monster may be in one of three states:</p>

<h4>Asleep</h4>

<ul>
	<li>They cannot move and their evasion is set to [â€“5].</li></ul>
	
<h4>Unwary</h4>

<ul>
	<li>They are awake and going about their business, but they do not know that you are there. Their evasion is halved.</li></ul>

<h4>Alert</h4>

<ul>
	<li>This is further subdivided into whether they are Confident, Aggressive, or Fleeing, but this is a matter of morale rather than stealth.</li></ul>
	
<p>The GM keeps track of an â€˜Alertnessâ€™ score for the monster. Monsters always start out Asleep or Unwary, but may as a result of your actions notice you. An â€˜Alertnessâ€™ of 0 or more means they are aware of you; between â€“1 and â€“10 means they are awake but unwary, and â€“11 or below usually means they are asleep. But be warned: not all inhabitants of Angband sleep!</p>

<p>Every minute, you make a Stealth roll (your stealth score + 1d10), to see how stealthy and quiet you are. Each minute the monsters makes a Perception roll (their perception score +1d10), to see how observant they are.  Various modifiers are applied, listed below. If at any time the monster's perception score is higher than your stealth score, their Alertness increases by difference which may make them move from Asleep to Unwary, or from Unwary to Alert.</p>

<h4><b>Modifiers to Stealth</b></h4>

<h4>Helpful factors:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Distance to monster: each square reduces monster perception by 1 point, and sound does not pass through stone or rubble at all.</li>
	<li>Each closed door on path reduces monster perception by 5.</li>
	<li>If you are in Stealth mode(but be warned that it makes you move more slowly than normal), you get a bonus of +5 to your stealth</li>
	<li>If you passed last turn, you get a bonus of +7 to your stealth(not cumulative with Stealth mode).</li></ul>
	
<h4>Hindrances:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>For each 10 lb of armour you are wearing (â€“1)</li>
	<li>Being attacked by one or more enemies (â€“2)</li>
	<li>Attacking one or more enemies (â€“2)</li>
	<li>Awake but unwary monsters which are in line of sight get some additional bonuses:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Doubles the modifiers for attacking or being attacked</li>
		<li>For every adjacent passable square (â€“1)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>So you may do well to stick to walls and corners.</li></ul></ul>
	<li>If you are singing, this reduces your stealth by a value equal to the noise level of the Song (see the list of Songs).</li>
	<li>Setting off some traps (â€“5 to â€“10)</li>
	<li>Landing from a leap (â€“5)</li></ul>

		<li>Unearthly screeching (20)</li></ul></ul>
		
<p>Stealth is thus quite abstract: a high stealth may mean little noise made, or that you kept in the shadows, or that you moved in an unobtrusive way, or let the noises that did occur sound like the natural background noises in the dungeon.</p>

<p>If you attack a monster, or an unaware monster tries to move into the square you are on, it will immediately notice you.</p>

<p>Once a monster has noticed you, it will become unwary again if you are out of sight of it, and it fails its perception check to spot you by 25 points or more. In this case, they lose a point of alertness for each point in excess of 25 that they fail by. This is very hard to achieve and will typically require you to get a fair distance from the monster and close some intervening doors. Note that this number is reduced to 15 if you have the ability â€˜Vanishâ€™. In addition, there are a few other ways in which you can make monsters become unwary:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is possible to put monsters to sleep with a Staff of Slumber or the Song of Lorien.</li>
	<li>Territorial monsters such as dragons will become unwary or even fall asleep if they have returned to their lairs and cannot see you.</li></ul>
	
<h3>Smithing</h3>

<p>As well as its many treasures, Angband has mighty forges, to arm the hosts who fight under Morgoth's banner. If you find one, you may be able to use such a forge to make yourself arms or armour, or even items of great power.</p>

<p>To create an item, you need:</p>

<ul>
	<li>to be at a forge which has enough resources left,</li>
	<li>to have the relevant Smithing Ability:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Weaponsmith</i> for weapons, including bows, arrows, and digging implements</li>
		<li><i>Armoursmith</i> for armour, including cloaks and shields</li>
		<li><i>Jeweller</i> for amulets, rings, and light sources</li>
		<li><i>Enchantment</i> if you want to add a special enchantment to a weapon, piece of armour, or light source</li></ul>
	<li>to have enough mithril, if the item requires it,</li>
	<li>to have a high enough Smithing skill (which depends on the item type and the bonuses you add to it),</li>
	<li>to put a part of yourself into the item, for certain types of enchantment:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>this can be experience points, which is a permanent cost (this is normally the cost for items which grant Abilities or give bonuses to Skills),</li>
		<li>it may instead be one or more stat points (which will be drained until such time as you eat or drink something which can restore them).</li></ul></ul>

<p>Making an item will take ten turns per point of difficulty, and makes noise, so you may be interrupted during this time. If this occurs you can resume your forging where you left off.</p>

<p>Some items are particularly easy to enchant. The costs for weapons (including bows), shields, body armour, helms, and amulets are lower than those for other equipment slots. The costs for robes, sceptres, and crowns are even lower.</p>

<h4>Creating artefacts</h4>

<p>Truly great smiths are capable of working beautiful or terrible pieces. If you have the Artifice ability, you will be able to create your own artefacts, which may be a matter for songs and legends of the future. This can let you customise your items much further, as well as going beyond the bounds of what is normally possible. In addition you can name your artefacts, and they are virtually indestructible. Creating an artefact is a great work, and requires three uses from a forge. These must all be at the same forge, so you must find a forge with enough resources; it is impossible to begin work at one and finish at another.</p>

<h4>Enchanted forges</h4>

<p>Many forges in Angband are used just to produce swords and mail for the legions of orcs, but some few are used for the axes of the Valaraukar or the armour of the Troll Guard of Gothmog. If you are lucky enough to be working at such a forge, it will give you a bonus to your Smithing, allowing you to make more powerful items than otherwise.</p>

<h3>Temporary Status Effects</h3>

<p>At certain times you may find yourself suffering from various effects. These will usually wear off in time, and there is typically some kind of consumable item to be found which will immediately remove the effect.</p>

<h4>Hunger</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Gorged</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You are so full that you cannot eat or drink any more until you recover</li></ul>
	<li>Full</li>
	<li>Hungry</li>
	<li>Weak</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You are at â€“1 to Strength until you manage to eat enough food to recover</li></ul>
	<li>Starving</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You take a point of damage each turn and no longer regenerate health</li></ul></ul>
		
<h4>Other negative effects</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Blind</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You cannot see anything.</li>
		<li>Note that Melee, Evasion, and Archery are halved against foes you cannot see.</li></ul>
	<li>Hallucinating</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Enemies and objects look like other enemies or objects.</li>
		<li>You occasionally see things that are not there.</li></ul>
	<li>Slow</li>
	<ul>
		<li>When you have a Speed of 1 you are considered Slow.</li>
		<li>May be caused by carrying more weight than your weight allowance (in which case the only way to stop it is to reduce your load).</li></ul>
	<li>Confused</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You are unable to choose directions normally for moving, attacking, etc.</li>
		<li>Attempting to choose a direction may randomly choose a nearby direction instead by rolling a d8.</li></ul>
	<li>Afraid</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You are too afraid to attack, either by melee, archery, or throwing.</li></ul>
	<li>Entranced</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You are frozen in place, cannot act, and are at [-5] evasion.</li>
		<li>This is broken the first time an enemy attacks you (or when enough time passes).</li></ul>
	<li>Stunned</li>
	<ul>
		<li>(1 to 50 turns on the stun counter)</li>
		<li>You get â€“2 to all of your skills</li></ul>
	<li>Heavily Stunned</li>
	<ul>
		<li>(51 to 100 turns on the stun counter)</li>
		<li>You get â€“4 to all of your skills</li></ul>
	<li>Knocked Out</li>
	<ul>
		<li>(101 to 105 turns on the stun counter)</li>
		<li>You are frozen in place, cannot act, and are at [-5] evasion.</li></ul>
	<li>Poisoned X</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You have been poisoned and will take X damage over the next few rounds.</li>
		<li>Each round you take 20% of X damage (rounded up) and X is decremented by this amount.</li></ul>
	<li>Bleeding X</li>
	<ul>
		<li>You are bleeding from an open wound.</li>
		<li>Handled like Poisoned X.</li></ul></ul>

<h4>Drained Stats</h4>

<ul>
	<li>This will not heal with time: you must find some item to cure it.</li></ul>
	
<h4>Resistances</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Elemental resistances are described in the section on the elements.</li>
	<li>Resistance to a status effect grants a very large bonus (+10) to any roll to avoid it.</li>
	<li>Free Action conveys resistance to Slowness and Entrancement, as well as helping you escape from Webs.</li>
	<li>See Invisible grants a +10 bonus to seeing otherwise invisible enemies.</li></ul>
	
<p>There are various positive status effects which may be granted by pieces of equipment or consumables (in the latter case they are always temporary). These include resistances, increased stats or light radius, speed, etc, which are generally explained elsewhere.</p>

<p>Of special note is Regeneration:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You regain health at three times the normal rate.</li>
	<li>You regain voice at three times the normal rate.</li>
	<li>You also suffer from great hunger, and will grow hungry at three times the normal rate</li></ul>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>Sil has neither classes nor levels, but it is far from the case that all characters of a given race are the same. As you adventure, you will accrue experience points, which you can spend in the character screen (accessed by pressing the @ symbol) to improve your prowess. There is a lot of flexibility in how you spend your experience, and this is a major part of the game.</p>

<h4><b>Sources of Experience</b></h4>

<p>All characters begin the game with 5,000 experience points to allocate. There are four sources of further experience in the game: encountering monsters; killing monsters; descending deeper into the Iron Hells; identifying objects.</p>

<h4>Encountering monsters</h4>

<ul>
	<li>You gain experience for encountering each individual enemy the first time you see it (or if you kill it without ever seeing it).</li>
	<li>For the first monster of a given type you encounter, you get d/5 experience points, where d is the depth (in feet) at which it is normally met. For subsequent encounters with monsters of the same type, the amount that you get decays: when you meet the second one you will only received Â½ this amount of experience, then â…“, then Â¼â€¦</li></ul>

<h4>Killing monsters</h4>

<ul>
	<li>For the first monster of a given type you kill, you get d/5 experience points, where d is the depth (in feet) at which it is normally met. The experience gained for killing additional monsters decays in exactly the same way as for encounters.</li>
	<li>Thus there is the same amount of experience available for killing monsters as for encountering them. All characters are likely to get more experience from encounters than from kills, and for some this may be much more.</li></ul>
	
<h4>Descending</h4>

<ul>
	<li>The first time you reach a depth of d feet (or deeper), you are awarded d experience points.</li></ul>
	
<h4>Identification</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Whenever your character identifies a new type of potion, herb, ring, amulet, horn, stave or special item, you are awarded 100 experience points.</li>
	<li>In the halls of Angband one may find ancient or renowned items of great power, which we collectively refer to as artefacts. Each time you identify an artefact, you are awarded 200 experience points.</li></ul>
	
<p>Note that there are several ways to deal with enemies apart from killing them: you may, for instance, sneak past them, make them flee before you, or run yourself. Characters who kill few enemies may thus get a little less experience than those who do, but may also have a higher chance of survival (combat is dangerous!).</p>

<h4><b>Spending Experience points</b></h4>

<p>Your character may use the lessons learned to train any of the eight skills detailed below. Your first point in a skill will cost 100 experience, your second 200, your third 300, and so on.</p>

<p>You may also learn various unique abilities. Each ability is linked to a skill, and may have requirements before you are able to learn it. For each skill, the first linked ability costs 500 experience points, the second costs 1000, the third costs 1500, and so on.</p>
