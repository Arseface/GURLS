<h1>Fantasy GURLS: Enneazatton</h1>

<h3>Table of Contents</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Enneazatton is the default fantasy setting and system for GURLS. Thematically it's based around a magic system grounded in the idea that the elements exist as separate spacial dimentions that can be percieved and moved along. Magical effects require an amount of energy or force behind them to create an effect, and generally speaking you can't move anything with magic that you couldn't move normally. Mechanically it's largely inspired by both Sil and Star Wars Saga Edition.</p>
