<h1>Fantasy GURLS: Enneazatton</h1>

<h3>Table of Contents</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Enneazatton is the default fantasy setting and system for GURLS. Thematically it's based around a magic system grounded in the idea that the elements exist as separate spacial dimentions that can be percieved and moved along. Magical effects require an amount of energy or force behind them to create an effect, and generally speaking you can't move anything with magic that you couldn't move normally. Mechanically it's largely inspired by both Sil and Star Wars: Saga Edition.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>Player Characters are largely defined by their attributes. All stats start at 1 and you may spend 19 points to increase them. The costs increase as the triangular numbers: 1, 3, 6, 10, and 15.</p>

<p>If an effect would reduce at stat to 0 you suffer severe penalties. Lost stat points take 1 day to restore per point that it is being raised to. Negative values are treated as 0 for effect and recovery, though they can stack to make recovery take longer.</p>

<h2>Race</h2>

<p>I had considered only having humans be playable in Enneazatton, but I wanted Formians so bad I decided to create other races to fill the world out as well.</p>

		<li>A human may spend a cast to feel an adrenaline rush. The rush lasts for 10 seconds.</li>
		<li>During the rush, all actions take 1 second shorter(to a minimum of 1 second), and all attributes are considered 1 higher.</li>
		<ul>
			Including constitution, gain 10 temporary hit points, lose 10 when this ends. This loss of hit points cannot cause an injury.</ul>
		<li>If adrenaline is used to overcast, instead take a stat drop to EVERY attribute.</li></ul></ul>
