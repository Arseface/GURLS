<h1>Fantasy GURLS: Enneazatton</h1>

<h3>Table of Contents</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Enneazatton is the default fantasy setting and system for GURLS. Thematically it's based around a magic system grounded in the idea that the elements exist as separate spacial dimentions that can be percieved and moved along. Magical effects require an amount of energy or force behind them, and generally speaking you can't move anything with magic that you couldn't move normally.</p>

<p>Mechanically it's a 3d6 roll-under the stat system with dice having a heavy influence on the flavor of successes and failures. Combat is handled with a count-up system and uses a stamina pool to manage what actions you can take.</p>

<p>All the dice used are six sided.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>Attributes are the core characteristics that define how well a person performs at certain tasks. How strong, fast, tough, and smart they are without regard to task specific training. Skill rolls in this system attempt to roll equal to or under their linked attribute.</p>

<p>If an effect would reduce at stat to 0 you suffer severe penalties. Lost stat points take 1 day to restore per point that it is being raised to. Negative values are treated as 0 for effect and recovery, though they can stack to make recovery take longer.</p>

<h3>Strength</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Strength is the measurement of physical might and force.</li>
	<li>Strength is used for skills involving physical force being applied.</li>
	<li>Strength determines the total wight you can weild without penalty. Each point in strength allows you to wield .5 KG in your hands.</li>
	<li>Strength is used to calculate hit point totals. Strength + Fortitdude + Modifiers = Hit Points</li></ul>

<h3>Agility</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Agility is the measurement of physical quickness.</li>
	<li>Agility is used for skills where physical speed is a major determiner for success.</li>
	<li>At the beginning of combat, you start with Stamina dice equal to your Agility.</li>
	<li>When you take the Sprint action in combat, you move 2 + Agility meters per second.</li></ul>

<h3>Dexterity</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Dexterity is the measurement of physical coordination.</li>
	<li>Dexterity is used for skills where physical precision is key.</li>
	<li>Dexterity tends to be important for ranged and light weapon combat.</li></ul>

<h3>Fortitude</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Fortitude is the measurement of physical toughness and endurance.</li>
	<li>Fortitude is used for skills that are physically strenuous.</li>
	<li>When you are recovering Stamina, your maximum is equal to your Fortitude.</li>
	<li>Fortitude is used to calculate hit point totals. Strength + Fortitdude + Modifiers = Hit Points</li></ul>

<h3>Logic</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Logic is the measurement of the ability to parse information.</li>
	<li>Logic is used for skills where you need to figure something out.</li></ul>

<h3>Instinct</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Instinct is the measurement of your ability to notice and respond to things.</li>
	<li>Instinct is used for skills that require you recognize or react to something.</li>
	<li>When combat begins, you start at 1d6 - Instinct seconds.</li></ul>

<h3>Empathy</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Empathy is the measurement of your ability to make emotional connections.</li>
	<li>Empathy is used for skills involving understanding and communicating with others.</li></ul>

<h3>Willpower</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Willpower is the measurement of how much mental force and endurance.</li>
	<li>Willpower is used for skills that are either mentally strenuous or require a forceful personality to succeed.</li>
	<li>Your maximum mana pool is equal to your Willpower.</li></ul>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>Skill rolls are how you handle almost all actions taken. When you attempt something with a chance of failure, you make a skill roll.</p>

<p>All skills are tied to three attributes. When you make a skill check, you roll three dice and compare each of them to the linked attribute. Which die is tied to which attribute is determined before you roll.</p>

<p>General skills cannot be trained and are used for general actions not defined here. The types of general skills are Physical(Str, Agi, Ins), Social(Emp, Emp, Wil), and Mental(Log, Log, Wil).</p>

<p>Trained skills have pools of points that can be used to adjust rolls. For every point in a skill, you can adjust a die in a skill roll by 1 point.</p>

<p>An end result of 6 is always a failure and a result of 1 is always a success, no matter what your stats are.</p>

<h3>Critcals</h3>

<p>Rolls of 1 and 6 are special. 1s often allow you to gain a benefit depending on the skill used, and 6s allow the GM to add additional setbacks. The nature of the benefit and setback should tie into the stat used for the roll.</p>

<p>Doubles 1s/6s are especially spectacular and are called criticals. A double 1 always succeeds and a double 6 always fails, regardless of the other roll and training.</p>

<p>Triple 1s/6s are even rarer and often frame the highlight of a session. The exact effects are up to the GM, but it should be significant and the GM should consider it their responsibility to make it as interesting as possible.</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>

<p>There are three main components to combat in Enneazatton. The count up turn order, the stamina system, and the actions players can perform.</p>

<p>The count up turn order is how you determine who is acting. Combat starts at 0 seconds, and everybody rolls 1d6 to determine their starting time. As time passes, the GM will announce the time and players who can move on that mark. Ties among team mates can be performed in any order. Unless there's a reason to do otherwise, it's usually easiest to just go clockwise around the table. Players always go before NPCs. In the case of players or NPCs fighting eachother, whoever has the lowest stamina goes first.</p>

<p>When the GM calls your time, you get to go. On your turn, you first resolve any pending actions. Tell the table the results of any rolls or actions you made and resolve them. Then, you announce the intent and target of your next action and end your turn. While other players are taking their turns, you can make any rolls that would be needed so that when they resolve you know what happens.</p>

<p>The stamina system determines the flow of combat. Stamina is the number of dice you have available to make rolls. Your maximum stamina is equal to your Fortitude + Willpower, and your starting stamina in combat is equal to your Agility. Most actions you take will either add dice to the pool, or require you to make rolls with them and remove them from the pool. It's generally easier to just keep a number of dice in front of you to show what you can use than recording your stamina like hit points.</p>

<p>Player actions are what players do during their turns, or in response to others. Almost all actions take time, and actions that require rolls take stamina. When you announce an action, it resolves after the time it takes passes on your next turn.</p>

<p>Some actions are taken as part of other actions. They usually add additional time to the action, and sometimes requires rolling additional dice.</p>

<p>Reactions to other actions can be declared at any time after they are announced, before they resolve. This means at least 1 second needs to pass before you can initiate a block. Reactions are considered part of the action they're responding to, and don't change the reactors initiative.</p>

<p>Multiple actions can be combined into a single announcement to action to speed up the resolution of things like movement. For example, a player might want to run 15 meters. They could then roll each turn and move, but not have to announce they plan on moving again. There's no mechanical benefit to doing this, it can just make things go smoother.</p>

<p>Criticals in Combat</p>

<p>Criticals in combat work slightly differently. For offensive actions, the effect a natural 1 has depends on the stat it's being rolled for. For defensive actions, each natural 1 has the same effect. In both cases the advantages of multiple 1s stack.</p>

<p>As with skills, double 1s/6s are special. Double 1s maximise the quality level of the action and ignore the other roll, stacking both the 1 advantages. Double 6s guarantee a failure.</p>

<p>Triple 1s and 6s often lead to an instant victory or defeat in single combat. Triple 1s on offenses do double damage before modifiers and cannot miss except from defensive triple 1s. Offensive triple 6s are a devestating failure, resulting in completely draining the stamina of the attacker and forcing them to take 3 seconds to recover their position. Triple 1s on defenses fully regenerate the stamina of the defender, and in the case of a block also do 3 stamina damage to the attacker. Triple 6s on defense drain stamina fully and guarantee a hit that would normally miss.</p>

<p>Injury and Death</p>

<p>When you run out of hit points, you are incapacitated and on the verge of death. You have three death dice that you roll every 10 seconds. For every two hit points below zero that would send you, start with one less die. A roll of 1 on a die adds a die to the pool, a roll of 6 removes one. If you'd end up with more than 3 dice, you stabilize and are no longer at risk of dying. If you run out of dice, you die.</p>

<p>Attacks against dying creatures reduce their death dice by the damage of the weapon.</p>
